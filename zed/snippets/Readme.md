# Zed snippets

This is just a collection of individual snippets, and will not work out of the box yet.

Zed can only have one snippet file per language, so they will need to be combined together on-device.

To share snippets between different languages (i.e. JS/TS/TSX) create a file, and create symlinks to it with the name of the other languages.
